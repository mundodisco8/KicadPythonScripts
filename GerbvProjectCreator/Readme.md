# GerbV Project Creator

I use GerbV as my gerber viewer. It's snappy and open source. Sadly, it doesn't recognize Gerbers by their file name, and doesn't remember layer colours, so it's a bit of a pain in the bum to have to go through the same setup every time that you load a bunch of Gerberinos.

This script creates a GerbV project based on the current Gerbers present. It looks for certain file name patterns and assign them to the different layers. If a KiCad gerber project file is present, it will use it too, but not all the gerber files generated by KiCad end up in that file, so you have to also check the rest of the files.

The `GerberLayerColours.py` file contains the colours used for each layer, in case you want to tweak it to your tastes. The stack order could also be tweaked if needed.

## What does it look like?

This is the "before", just a bunch of gerbers dragged and dropped to the window

Not very good... let's run this thing...

![after](../support/img/Project_After.png)

Well, that's better, right?

## Known issues / To Do:

* It hard-links to my GerbV installation in my Windows computer, so it will complain if you run it in another computer that is not my computer.
* GerbV complains with a warning if you load an empty Gerber. Empty gerbers are not empty files, but I haven't managed to determine when a Gerber is empty and when it's not, so for the time being, it will give you a warning if you load the Gerber for a layer without elements.
* It only supports up to 4 layers. It's not difficult to make it work with more than 4 layers.
* The way that pairs layers and files is a bit clunky, and can be improved.
